# Create a new branch from a branch (not main)
# ==========================

# Switch to the source branch (not main)
git checkout [source-branch]  # Replace [source-branch] with the branch name

git pull origin [source-branch]  # Sync the source branch with its remote

# Create and switch to the new branch
git checkout -b [new-branch-name]  # Replace [new-branch-name] with the new branch name

# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin [new-branch-name]  # Set the upstream branch on GitHub

# ==========================
# Merge code from one branch to another (not main)
# ==========================

# Switch to the target branch (the branch to receive changes)
git checkout [target-branch]  # Replace [target-branch] with the branch name

git pull origin [target-branch]  # Ensure the target branch is up-to-date

# Merge the source branch into the target branch
git merge [source-branch]  # Replace [source-branch] with the branch name

# Resolve merge conflicts if necessary
# - Open files with conflicts and manually resolve them
# - Mark them as resolved:
git add [conflicted-file]  # Stage resolved files

git commit  # Finalize the merge

# Push the updated target branch to the remote repository
git push origin [target-branch]  # Push the changes

# Handle untracked files
# ==========================

# Check the status of untracked files
git status  # Lists all untracked files

# Add untracked files to the current branch
git add [file1.txt] [file2.txt]  # Stage specific untracked files
git commit -m "Add untracked files"  # Commit them to the branch

# If untracked files are temporary and should be ignored, add them to .gitignore
echo "temp/" >> .gitignore  # Example: Ignore all files in the temp directory
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore  # Example: Ignore all log files
git add .gitignore  # Stage the updated .gitignore
git commit -m "Update .gitignore to exclude untracked files"

# ==========================
# Stashing and restoring changes
# ==========================

# Stash uncommitted changes

# Apply the latest stash and remove it from the stash list
git stash pop  # Restore the latest stash

# Apply a specific stash without removing it
git stash apply stash@{0}  # Replace stash@{0} with the stash you want

# Drop a specific stash (if no longer needed)
