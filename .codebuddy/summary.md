# Project Summary

## Overview
This project is a backend application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It serves as a RESTful API for user authentication and management, including functionalities for user registration, login, profile management, and password changes. The project utilizes various libraries for error handling, validation, logging, and documentation.

### Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Express.js (for building the API)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
- **Main Libraries**:
  - `bcryptjs` (for password hashing)
  - `jsonwebtoken` (for JWT authentication)
  - `express-async-handler` (for handling asynchronous route handlers)
  - `morgan` (for logging HTTP requests)
  - `joi` (for data validation)
  - `swagger-jsdoc` and `swagger-ui-express` (for API documentation)
  - `dotenv` (for environment variable management)
  - `cors` (for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a secure and efficient backend service for managing user accounts, including registration, authentication, and profile management. It aims to facilitate the development of applications that require user management functionalities while ensuring security through hashed passwords and JWT for session management.
